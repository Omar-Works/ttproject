Currently we'll be working on a random quote generator website but it's still *raw*. Any team member is free to make changes by creating a new branch and make pull requests on it. 
(This is branch1, I was thinking of adding more things to this website so I decided on adding tags for each random quote [ or perphaps even add search by tags function idk] )
